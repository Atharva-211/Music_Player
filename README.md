# TuneBox
Simple music player application developed using Python and the tkinter library.

The "Music Player" code is primarily a GUI application, so it doesn't produce traditional console 
or command-line output that you would see in a text-based program. Instead, it generates a graphical 
user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the application. Here's what you can expect 
to see as the output when running this code.

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI): When you run the code, a graphical window will appear. This window is the main
2. interface of the music player application. It includes various GUI elements such as labels, buttons, and text areas. 
3. Initial Display: 
  - The "Now Playing" label will initially show "Now Playing: No song selected." 
  - The "List of Songs (Sorted)" label will indicate that the playlist is sorted initially. 
3. Playlist Display: 
  - The "List of Songs" area will be initially empty (if no songs have been added yet). 
4. Buttons: 
  - You will see buttons for various functions, such as play/pause, next/previous song, shuffle, sort, add song, and delete song. 
5. Status Messages: 
  - The "Status" area will initially be empty but will be used to display status messages, such as "Song playing" or "No songs in the playlist." 

Here's what you can expect when interacting with the application: 
  - Adding Songs: You can use the "‚ûï" (Add) button to add songs to the playlist. This will open a file dialog for selecting MP3 files. 
  - Deleting Songs: You can use the "‚ûñ" (Delete) button to remove songs from the playlist. The code will update the list of songs accordingly. 
  - Playback Control: The "‚èØÔ∏è" (Play/Pause) button allows you to toggle between playing and pausing a song. 
  - Navigating the Playlist: You can use the "‚è≠Ô∏è" (Next) and "‚èÆÔ∏è" (Previous) buttons to move to the next or previous song in the playlist. 
  -Shuffle and Sort: The "üîÄ" (Shuffle) and "üîÅ" (Sort) buttons allow you to shuffle or sort the playlist. 
  -Status Updates: As you interact with the application, status messages will be displayed in the "Status" area to provide feedback about the actions you've taken. 
  The primary output of this code is the graphical user interface that enables you to manage and play music in a user-friendly manner.
  It provides visual feedback through labels, buttons, and text areas, allowing you to control your music playlist and playback.
